# Installation

Install it with NPM:

```bash
npm install @studiometa/vue-mapbox-gl
```

You will have to install the peer dependencies in order for the components to work correctly:

```bash
# Install mapbox-gl
npm install mapbox-gl
# The geocoder package is only required if you use the `MapboxGeocoder` component
npm install @mapbox/mapbox-gl-geocoder
```
